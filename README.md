My Data Analysis Journey
# 👋 Hi, I'm Oluwatosin — Aspiring Data Analyst
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!
I'm a passionate and detail-driven data analyst with a growing command of **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**. Through the help of great Tutors at the Incubator Hub, self-guided learning and real-world case studies, I’ve developed strong analytical and storytelling skills that bring clarity to raw data.
## 🧭 My Data Analyst Learning Journey
I began my journey with a strong interest in uncovering insights from raw data. Over time, I’ve built core analytical skills by working on real-world case studies across different industries — including HR, retail, and e-commerce — using tools like **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**.
