### 3 🟢 KMS Inventory SQL Case Study -
**Role:** Data Analyst (SQL + Excel)
- As part of a business analytics case for a retail company, I conducted deep-dive SQL analysis across customer segments, sales regions, product categories, and shipping methods. I worked directly in **SQL Server**, wrote performance-optimized queries, and exported insights to Excel for review.
**Key Contributions:**
- Identified top and bottom performing customers and product categories
- Assessed shipping costs vs. order priorities
- Joined and filtered data across multiple dimensions (customer, time, geography)
- Wrote reusable SQL scripts, exported result sets, and documented the entire process
